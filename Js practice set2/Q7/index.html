    <h1>
      Write a JavaScript program that prompts the user to enter a year using
      prompt. Convert the input to a number and then check if it's a leap year
      using the following conditions: If the year is divisible by 4 but not
      divisible by 100, or it's divisible by 400, it's a leap year. Otherwise,
      it's not a leap year. Display an alert with the corresponding message.
    </h1>
    <script>
      let year = prompt("Enter any year");
      if ((year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || year % 400 == 0) {
        console.log("It is a leap year");
      } else {
        console.log("Not a leap year");
